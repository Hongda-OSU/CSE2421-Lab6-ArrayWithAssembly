I certify that I completed all of the work myself with no aid from anyone aside from the instructor or the undergraduate graders.

For grader to modified:
*****************************************************************************************************************
(1): this is the string part where grader could modify more or less strings in myArr[]

/* grader could add more/less strings here, string are label with str(i) */
str1:
	.string "I'm big fan of small world. No like big word or good grammar. Grammar too hard."
str2:
	.string "I really hate how nice the weather is getting."
str3:
	.string "What"
str4:
	.string "Amazing, isn't it? With just the slightest touch the material warps around the skin effortlessly."
str5:
	.string "Can you believe how much ligma is going around this year?"

*****************************************************************************************************************
(2): this is the array part where grader could add or remove the string label

/* create an array of pointers myArr, grader could change how many strings stored in myArr[] */
myArr:	/* char *myArr[5] = {str1, str2, str3, str4, str5}; */
	.quad	str1
	.quad	str2
	.quad	str3
	.quad	str4
	.quad	str5

*****************************************************************************************************************
(3): this is the array size part where grader could change the integer base on how many strings are in myArr[]

/* size is determined by how many strings in myArr[], default as 5 */
size:
	.long 5

*****************************************************************************************************************
(4): this is the choice part where grader could set program as default mode or bonus mode 

/* grader choice for Part1, 0 as default, other as bonus */
choiceP1:
	.long 0
/* grader choice for Part2, 0 as default, other as bonus */
choiceP2:
	.long 0
/* grader choice for Part3, 0 as default, other as bonus */
choiceP3:
	.long 0
